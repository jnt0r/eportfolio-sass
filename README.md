# e-portfolio SASS

Software Engineering e-portfolio about SASS

## Introduction

Hey everyone, this weeks e-Portfolio is about SASS. I will talk about why/when you should use SASS and what advantages and features SASS provides.

## Components

The components we are going to use:

- sass

- VSCode (you can use your prefered text-editor)

- Web browser (use your prefered one)

## Live demo

If you want to follow me along with my live demo you need SASS installed and should clone this repository.

To install SASS go to this [site](https://sass-lang.com/install) and choose the installation option you prefer (I personally use npm). To verify you installed SASS correctly run `sass --version` to verify it is working correctly. If you want to make another test you can run `sass demo/scss:demo/css`. This should generate a directory called `css` inside the demo folder. Also there should be the files `demo.css` and `demo.css.map`. If you look into the css file it should only contain one simple css rule and no errors.

You know how to contact me if you have any issue :)
